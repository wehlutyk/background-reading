## Sentence recall

* [Mary C Potter & Linda Lombardi (1990), Regeneration in the short-term recall of sentences](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0749-596X(90)90042-X)
* [Mary C. Potter & Linda Lombardi (1997), Syntactic Priming in Immediate Recall of Sentences](http://dx.doi.org.gate3.inist.fr/10.1016/0749-596X(90)90042-X)

They lend evidence to the idea that **in immediate sentence recall, sentences are stored as unordered bags of words (=a conceptual representation) and regenerated on-the-fly**, changing the syntax if necessary to add a word. Lure words (presented before recall, before/after original) appear more in listening than reading. The fact that the re-generated syntax is often close to the original would be due to **syntactical priming** (just due to perceiving the original sentence).

* [Elizabeth Jefferies, Matthew A. Lambon Ralph, Alan D. Baddeley (2004), Automatic and controlled processing in sentence recall: The role of long-term and working memory](http://dx.doi.org.gate3.inist.fr/10.1006/jmla.1997.2546)

Discusses the involvement of attention and control in sentence recall: **sentence recall works better when you can relate the meaning to long-term memories, and that's mandatory if recall is larger than the phonological loop**.
